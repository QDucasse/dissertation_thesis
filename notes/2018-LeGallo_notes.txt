ABSTRACT
============
As CMOS scaling reaches its technological limits, a radical departure from
traditional von Neumann systems, which involve separate processing and memory
units, is needed in order to significantly extend the performance of todayâ€™s
computers. In-memory computing is a promising approach in which nanoscale
resistive memory devices, organised in a computational memory unit, are used for
both processing and memory. However, to reach the numerical accuracy typically
required for data analytics and scientific computing, limitations arising from
device variability and non-ideal device characteristics need to be addressed.
Here we introduce the concept of mixed-precision in-memory computing, which
combines a von Neumann machine with a computational memory unit. In this hybrid
system, the computational memory unit performs the bulk of a computational task,
while the von Neumann machine implements a backward method to iteratively
improve the accuracy of the solution. The system therefore benefits from both
the high precision of digital computing and the energy/areal efficiency of
in-memory computing. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the approach
by accurately solving systems of linear equations, in particular, a system of
5,000 equations using 998,752 phase-change memory devices.

BACKGROUND
============
Nanoscale resistive memory devices (=memristive devices) can store information
in their conductance states and remember the history of the current that has
flowed through them.
-> Basis of in-memory computing, an approach where both information processing
and storing data are performed on the same physical devices.

SOLUTION
============
Computational task = two parts:
-approximate solution (high computational load and low-precision memory unit)
-computation of the resulting error (low computational load and high-precision memory unit)
--> Result adapted then rerun through the cycle.


The hybrid system comprises a computational memory unit, which performs the bulk
of a given computational task, and a high-precision processing unit which
implements a backward method to improve the accuracy of the solution.

Linear equations are solved using a PCM (phase-change memory) chip to perform
matrix-vector multiplications.

The mixed-precision is an iterative refinement algorithm. The inner solver is
an iterative Krylov subspace method such as the Conjugate Gradient method or
the Generalised Minimum Residual method.
