ABSTRACT
============
A new precision model is proposed for the acceleration of all-atom classical
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs). This
precision model replaces double precision arithmetic with fixed point integer
arithmetic for the accumulation of force components as compared to a previously
introduced model that uses mixed single/double precision arithmetic. This
significantly boosts performance on modern GPU hardware without sacrificing
numerical accuracy. We present an implementation for NVIDIA GPUs of both
generalised Born implicit solvent simulations as well as explicit solvent
simulations using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm for long-range
electrostatics using this precision model. Tests demonstrate both the
performance of this implementation as well as its numerical stability for
constant energy and constant temperature bio-molecular MD as compared to a
double precision CPU implementation and double and mixed single/double precision
GPU implementations.

BACKGROUND
============
Other paper presents AMBER: PMEMD engine that uses single/double precision (SPDP)
arithmetic to achieve max performance --> single precision performance is better
The model presented allowed to achieve better results if the architecture
comparative performance (single/double) was no worse than 10 to 1.

============
SOLUTION
============
New precision model named SPFP: single precision + 64-bit fixed point integer
arithmetic in place of double precision floating point arithmetic.

Three precision models:
-SPDP: real-space and non-bonded PME (single) / bonded and force accumulation (double)

Cast of a 32-bit float to a 64-bit integer.

Rapid atomic operations by using a combination of Q24.40 and Q34.30 fixed
arithmetic for accumulation of forces and energies. Delivers an accuracy
comparable to a SPDP model but with better performance. Memory footprint has
been reduced (significantly in the case of implicit solvent GB).
