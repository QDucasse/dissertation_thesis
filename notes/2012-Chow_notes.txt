ABSTRACT
============
This paper introduces a novel mixed precision methodology applicable to any
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. It involves the use of data-paths with reduced
precision, and the resulting errors are corrected by auxiliary sampling. An
analytical model is developed for a reconfigurable accelerator system with a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a general purpose processor (GPP).
Optimisation based on mixed integer geometric programming is employed for
determining the optimal reduced precision and optimal resource allocation among
the MC data-paths and correction data- paths. Experiments show that the proposed
mixed precision methodology requires up to 11 % additional evaluations while
less than 4 % of all the evaluations are computed in the reference precision;
the resulting designs are up to 7.1 times faster and 3.1 times more energy
efficient than baseline double precision FPGA designs, and up to 163 times
faster and 170 times more energy efficient than quad-core software designs
optimised with the Intel compiler and Math Kernel Library. Our methodology also
produces designs for pricing Asian options which are 4.6 times faster and 5.5
times more energy efficient than NVIDIA Tesla C2070 GPU implementations.

BACKGROUND
============
Monte-Carlo simulations are a class of algorithms based on randomisation which
are extensively used in many high performance computing applications. Well
suited to FPGA due to its parallel nature.

Actual Monte-Carlo designs exploiting the better performance/lower accuracy
trade-off are computed with a certain tolerance on precision. However, if
very precise outputs are required, the data-paths with lower performance will
have to be taken.

============
SOLUTION
============

Finite precision error handling is novel. Instead of keeping the output error
within a certain tolerance, the data-path is initially constructed with a
reduced precision. Then, a sampling process will use both the precision reference
and the reduced precision to correct the error.

This methodology can be split between different processors. A GPP in a host PC
can be used for the sampling while the reduced computations were done on
customised data-paths on the FPGA.

The paper brings:
- Error analysis that separates finite precision error and sampling errors
- Techniques for partitioning workloads on different precisions for sampling
to a reconfigurable accelerator (FPGA(s) + GPP(s))
- Optimisation method based on analytical model for execution time, Mixed Integer
Geometric Programming
