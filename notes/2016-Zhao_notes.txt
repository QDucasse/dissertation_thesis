ABSTRACT
============
This paper presents a novel reconfigurable framework for training Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed framework is based on reconfiguring a
streaming datapath at runtime to cover the training cycle for the various layers
in a CNN. The streaming datapath can support various parameterised modules which
can be customised to produce implementations with different trade-offs in
performance and resource usage. The modules follow the same input and output
data layout, simplifying configuration scheduling. For different layers,
instances of the modules contain different computation kernels in parallel,
which can be customised with different layer configurations and data precision.
The associated models on performance, resource and bandwidth can be used in
deriving parameters for the datapath to guide the analysis of design trade-offs
to meet application requirements or platform constraints. They enable estimation
of the implementation specifications given different layer configurations, to
maximise performance under the constraints on bandwidth and hardware resources.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed module design targeting Maxeler
technology can achieve a performance of 62.06 GFLOPS for 32-bit floating-point
arithmetic, outperforming existing accelerators. Further evaluation based on
training LeNet-5 shows that the proposed framework achieves about 4 times faster
than CPU implementation of Caffe and about 7.5 times more energy efficient than
the GPU implementation of Caffe.
