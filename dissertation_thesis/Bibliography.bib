This precision model replaces double precision arithmetic with fixed point integer arithmetic for the accumulation of force components as compared to a previously introduced model that uses mixed single/double precision arithmetic. This significantly boosts performance on modern GPU hardware without sacrificing numerical accuracy. We present an implementation for NVIDIA GPUs of both generalized Born implicit solvent simulations as well as explicit solvent simulations using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm for long-range electrostatics using this precision model. Tests demonstrate both the performance of this implementation as well as its numerical stability for constant energy and constant temperature biomolecular MD as compared to a double precision CPU implementation and double and mixed single/double precision GPU implementations."

	title = "Accuracy, Training Time and Hardware Efficiency Trade-Offs for Quantized Neural Networks on FPGAs",
	abstract = "Neural networks have proven a successful AI approach in many application areas. Some neural network deployments require low inference latency and lower power requirements to be useful e.g. autonomous vehicles and smart drones. Whilst FPGAs meet these requirements, hardware needs of neural networks to execute often exceed FPGA resources.Emerging industry led frameworks aim to solve this problem by compressing the topology and precision of neural networks, eliminating computations that require memory for execution. Compressing neural networks inevitably comes at the cost of reduced inference accuracy.This paper uses Xilinx's FINN framework to systematically evaluate the trade-off between precision, inference accuracy, training time and hardware resources of 64 quantized neural networks that perform MNIST character recognition.We identify sweet spots around 3 bit precision in the quantization design space after training with 40 epochs, minimising both hardware resources and accuracy loss. With enough training, using 2 bit weights achieves almost the same inference accuracy as 3-8 bit weights.",
