Computers can represent numbers in different ways. Representations of them can differ in their binary translation. Integers, Floating-Point and Fixed-Point representations coexist with their own benefits and drawbacks. Reduced- and mixed- precision have been a focus of the literature since the 1960's. Using lower precision often increases performance at the cost of negligible loss in accuracy. Methods to use mixed-precision are iterative refinement (a sequential process to obtain high accuracy from low accuracy components) or analysis and rewriting (analyse the types chosen and choose the best fit). Those methods have direct state-of-the art applications in different fields. Mathematical computations directly benefit from any improvement in performance and allow an increase in physics simulations. On the other hand, deep learning and its applications (image visualisation, speech recognition) can be implemented using reduced-precision on its parameters. Another important focus is the choice of the hardware architecture. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are the state-of-the-art parallel pieces of hardware. FPGAs show an affinity with mixed-precision as it is naturally implemented. The aim of this report is to give the reader an insight on mixed-precision, its methods of implementation, applications that can benefit from it and hardware architectures.

\acknowledgements{\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{1em}} % Add a gap in the Contents, for aesthetics

My thanks go to every person that helped during the redaction of this paper. I am grateful for Pr. Lo√Øc Lagadec and Dr. Pascal Cotret that proposed the subject to me. I thank them for their weekly guidance and help. I also want to express my gratitude for Pr. Rob Stewart that accepted to supervise the project as well. He helped ensure the report was resourceful and on point with the aimed project.

My thanks also go to the developers in the Xilinx Research Labs that provided me with a board to conduct my experiments on and guided me in a lot of steps through the development of their tools. My thanks go to M. Yaman Umuroglu, M. Alessandro Pappalardo and M. Henrik Borras for their insight and quality advice.
